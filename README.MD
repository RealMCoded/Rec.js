# Archival Notice

As of November 13, 2024, Rec.js has been archived.

This is a personal choice of mine mostly due to the fact that i don't really care that much about old Rec Room anymore. 

Feel free to fork and do whatever you want with the project. Maybe someone will patch it for newer builds :P

## About Rec.js

Rec.js is a server for old Rec Room builds!

This project is similar to OpenRec or Vault Server. If you're looking for a server that is more like OpenRec Live or OpenLabs, check out [LunarRec](https://github.com/RealMCoded/LunarRec).

> *Note: LunarRec is not production ready software. Use at your own risk!*

## Disclaimer

This project is not affiliated with [Rec Room](https://recroom.com/) in any way, nor intends to infringe on their copyrights. Distributing old versions of Rec Room is copyright infringement, so that's why Rec.js does not come bundled with Rec Room at all.

## (not so) Frequently Asked Questions

### Q: How is Rec.js different than OpenRec?

**A:** At the moment, there's not much of a difference between OpenRec and Rec.js. They both do the same job, which is allowing old Rec Room builds to be playable again.

Since OpenRec is no longer being worked on, Rec.js exists to be an improvement of OpenRec to include more features and better support for old Rec Room builds.

### Q: Is it possible to play with other people with Rec.js?

**A:** Yes! Multiplayer is handled with a [Photon PUN server](https://www.photonengine.com/pun) and a [Photon Voice server](https://www.photonengine.com/en-us/Voice), not via the RecNet server.

### Q: Is it possible for someone using OpenRec and someone using Rec.js to play together?

**A:** It is indeed possible for the same reasons listed [here](#q-is-it-possible-to-play-with-other-people-with-recjs)

### Q: My build doesn't work!

**A:** There are multiple reasons why this might be happening.

- We do not support late 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, or 2023 builds.

- If there is no console output when you launch your build, that means the builds RecNet server domain has not been modified. 

- If there is console output but there is a "Failed to connect to RecNet!" error, [Submit an issue!](https://github.com/RealMCoded/Rec.js/issues)
